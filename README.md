# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

Creates a ECR Repo to push images from github

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm install`
* `cdk list`

* `cdk synth`
* `cdk deploy`

For deploy / destroy use a profile to define AWS user / account and region. For example, add `--profile cdk-user`
